## TIC - TAC - TOE

#### How to Setup?

- Fork the repository to your GitHub account.
- Clone the forked repository to your local machine.
- Add upstream to the cloned repository using the command `git remote add upstream <http/ssh link>` keeping the terminal head at the cloned project folder.
- The project is now setup and can be directly opened from Android Studio.

#### How to Contribute?

- Get yourself assigned to the issue you would like working on.
- Create a new working branch from clean `main` branch using `git checkout -b <branch_name>`. All your changes should be made on new created branch only.
- Stage and commit the changes once done. (`git add . && git commit -m "<commit_message>"`.)
- Push your committed changes to your forked repository using `git push origin <branch_name>`.
- Create a pull request merging changes from `origin/<branch_name>` to `upstream/main`.
- In case of requested changes, do those changes and repeat from step 3.
- Get your PR merged. ðŸŽ‰
